Project: Analyzing Water Risk Exposure of Global Power Plant
Infrastructure</h1>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This repository hosts the work for my Data Science Capstone project.
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the exposure of global
power plant infrastructure to current and future water-related risks.
This involves integrating detailed data on power plants worldwide with
comprehensive water risk indicators to identify potential
vulnerabilities and highlight areas of concern at the intersection of
energy production and water scarcity.</p>
<p>This repository is a fork of the World Resources Instituteâ€™s (WRI) <a
href="https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database">Global Power
Plant Database</a>.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-this-fork">Purpose of this Fork</h2>
<p>This fork serves as the central workspace for: * Data curation and
preprocessing scripts. * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks. *
Project documentation and deliverables. * Storing any developed models
or dashboards (or links to them).</p>
<h2 id="key-research-questions-tentative">Key Research Questions
(Tentative)</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the current level of water stress and other water risks
faced by different types of power plants globally and in specific
regions?</li>
<li>How might these water risks change for existing power infrastructure
under various future climate and socioeconomic scenarios (e.g., 2030,
2050, 2080)?</li>
<li>Are there particular types of power plants or geographical regions
that are disproportionately vulnerable to water scarcity?</li>
<li>What are the potential implications of these water risks for energy
security and sustainable development?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="datasets-used">Datasets Used</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>WRI Global Power Plant Database:</strong> This comprehensive
database provides locations, capacities, fuel types, commissioning
years, and other information for tens of thousands of power plants
worldwide. (Forked from <a
href="https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database">wri/global-power-plant-database</a>)</li>
<li><strong>WRI Aqueduct 4.0 Water Risk Atlas:</strong> This dataset
provides detailed global water risk indicators, including:
<ul>
<li>Baseline water stress, water depletion, inter-annual variability,
and seasonal variability (both monthly and annualized).</li>
<li>Future projections of these water risks under different climate
scenarios (e.g., SSPs/RCPs) and for various time horizons (e.g., 2030,
2050, 2080).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="methodology-tools">Methodology &amp; Tools</h2>
<p>The project will involve the following general steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning and preparing the Global Power Plant Database.</li>
<li>Processing and understanding the Aqueduct 4.0 water risk data
(baseline and future projections).</li>
<li>Geospatially linking power plant locations (latitude/longitude) to
the relevant water basin identifiers (<code>pfaf_id</code>) from the
Aqueduct dataset. This will likely involve using Pfafstetter basin
shapefiles.</li>
<li>Merging the power plant data with the water risk indicators.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong></li>
