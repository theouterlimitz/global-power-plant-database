Project Description: Assessing Water Risk Exposure of Global Power Plant Infrastructure
1. Overview 
The global energy sector is fundamental to economic development, public health, and modern life. However, a significant portion of global electricity generation, particularly thermal power plants (coal, gas, nuclear) and hydropower, relies heavily on the availability of adequate and reliable water resources for processes such as cooling, steam generation, and direct energy production. The intricate relationship between water and energy production is often referred to as the "water-energy nexus." With increasing global population, economic growth, and the impacts of climate change leading to more frequent and severe water stress (droughts, altered precipitation patterns, increased variability), the resilience of energy infrastructure to water-related risks is a growing international concern.
2. The Problem That Needs to Be Solved
While the general dependence of power generation on water is known, a comprehensive, granular understanding of the specific water risk exposure faced by individual power plants worldwide—both currently and under future climate and socioeconomic scenarios—is often lacking or fragmented. This project aims to address this gap by identifying and quantifying the varying levels of water risk (such as water stress, depletion, and variability) faced by a global portfolio of power plants. The specific problem is to assess which types of power generation facilities, in which specific geographical basins, are most vulnerable to current and projected future water challenges, thereby providing insights into potential threats to energy security and production.
3. Why Does This Problem Matter?
Understanding and quantifying the water risk exposure of power plants is critical for several reasons:
Energy Security: Water scarcity or variability can lead to reduced operational efficiency of power plants, temporary shutdowns, or even long-term unviability, directly impacting energy supply and grid reliability.
Economic Impacts: Disruption in power generation due to water issues can have significant economic consequences, affecting industrial output, commercial activities, and incurring costs associated with mitigation or alternative energy sourcing.
Sustainable Development: This analysis aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) concerning clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), and climate action (SDG 13).
Investment and Policy: A clearer understanding of these risks can inform investment decisions for new power infrastructure, guide policy-making for water resource management in the energy sector, and support the development of climate change adaptation strategies for existing assets.
Environmental Co-benefits: Promoting water-efficient energy systems can also reduce the strain on local ecosystems and water resources shared with other users (agriculture, domestic supply).
4. What are the Datasets That You Will Consider to Solve This Problem?

To address this problem, this project will primarily utilize the following publicly available datasets:
A. WRI Global Power Plant Database (GPPD)
Brief Description: A comprehensive, open-source database of power plants around the world, geolocated and containing information on capacity, fuel type, commissioning year, ownership, and other attributes.
Context (How Collected/Represents): Compiled by the World Resources Institute (WRI) from numerous public and commercial sources, with data standardized using internal scripts and thesauri (as explored in the gppd_generation_library.py from the source repository). The output CSV used for this project represents the processed and harmonized data.
Major Variables/Fields Available:
Identifiers: gppd_idnr (unique plant ID), name, country (ISO3 code), country_long (full name).
Characteristics: capacity_mw (plant capacity in megawatts), primary_fuel (standardized primary fuel type), other_fuel1/2/3 (secondary fuels, though data is sparse), commissioning_year (often missing, ~50% complete), owner (often missing, ~40% complete).
Location: latitude, longitude (WGS84).
Generation: generation_gwh_2013 through generation_gwh_2019 (reported annual generation, highly sparse, some negative values requiring investigation), estimated_generation_gwh_2017 (estimated annual generation, relatively complete and likely a key generation metric for this project).
Source Information: source, url, geolocation_source.
B. WRI Aqueduct 4.0 Water Risk Atlas
Brief Description: A suite of tools and datasets from WRI that map and analyze current and future water risks globally. This project will utilize the basin-level outputs.
Context (How Collected/Represents): Indicators are derived from outputs of the PCR-GLOBWB 2 hydrological model, which processes baseline (historical, 1979-2019) and future projected inputs based on CMIP6 climate forcings (as detailed in the "Aqueduct 4.0 Production Scripts" README). Gridded model data is spatially aggregated to HydroBASIN Level 6 (catchment) summaries (pfaf_id). Future projections represent summarized long-term trends for milestone periods (e.g., "2030" for 2015-2045, "2050" for 2035-2065, "2080" for 2065-2095) under different socioeconomic pathways and climate scenarios (SSP1 RCP2.6 "optimistic", SSP2 RCP7.0 "business as usual" based on example, SSP5 RCP8.5 "pessimistic").
Major Datasets & Variables/Fields Available (based on data_dictionary_water-risk-atlas.md and inspected CSVs):
Aqueduct 4.0 Baseline Monthly Data (Aqueduct40_baseline_monthly_y2023m07d05.csv):
Provides monthly baseline (1979-2019 trend) indicators for ~15,800 pfaf_id basins.
Key Indicators: bws (Baseline Water Stress), bwd (Baseline Water Depletion), iav (Interannual Variability).
Each indicator has _raw (raw value), _score (0-5), _cat (category code, -1 to 4), and _label (text description) values for each of the 12 months.
Data Quality Note: No standard NaNs, but iav indicators use -9999 as a NoData/error code, and some bws/bwd_raw use 9999 as a capped extreme value.
Aqueduct 4.0 Future Annual Data (Aqueduct40_future_annual_y2023m07d05.csv):
Provides future annual projections for ~16,400 pfaf_id basins, though ~560 of these have no future data across all indicators.
Time Horizons: "30" (2015-2045), "50" (2035-2065), "80" (2065-2095).
Scenarios: bau (Business as Usual), opt (Optimistic), pes (Pessimistic).
Key Indicators: ba (Available blue water), ww (Gross water demand), ws (Water stress), wd (Water depletion), iv (Interannual variability), sv (Seasonal variability).
Each indicator has _r (raw), _s (score), _c (category), and _l (label) values for each scenario and time horizon.
Data Quality Note: Many indicators use -9999 as a NoData/error code within otherwise non-null rows.
Aqueduct 4.0 Baseline Annual Data (To be used/under consideration):
The data dictionary indicates this is the main Aqueduct framework dataset, containing all 13 baseline annual indicators (including groundwater table decline, flood risk, drought risk, water quality, regulatory risks) for pfaf_id basins, along with richer geographical identifiers (country codes, names, sub-national names).
It also includes "Grouped Water Risk" scores with weighting schemes for different industries, including "Electric Power" (elp), which will be highly relevant.
Linking Strategy: The Global Power Plant Database (lat/long) will be geospatially linked to the Aqueduct 4.0 basin-level data (pfaf_id) using HydroBASIN Level 6 shapefiles to assign water risk indicators to each power plant.
Additional Datasets: Depending on the analysis direction, I may consider incorporating additional datasets such as HydroBASIN Level 6 shapefiles for the geospatial join, or potentially country-level socioeconomic indicators for broader contextual analysis if time permits.
